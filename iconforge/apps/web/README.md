# IconFull Web

IconFull Web is a browser-based icon generation studio built with Next.js.

It helps creators, founders, and teams generate complete app icon packs from a single source image, including:

- Favicons
- Apple Touch icon
- Android icons
- Open Graph image
- Web manifest-ready assets

## Why use IconFull Web?

- **Fast workflow:** go from one image to production-ready icon assets in minutes.
- **Privacy-first approach:** processing is done locally in the browser flow, so you can keep control of your files.
- **Consistent output:** standardized sizes and naming for modern web/app requirements.
- **Perfect for iteration:** quickly test branding updates before final export.

## What you can generate

- `favicon.ico`
- `favicon-16x16.png`
- `favicon-32x32.png`
- `apple-touch-icon.png`
- `android-chrome-192x192.png`
- `android-chrome-512x512.png`
- `og-1200x630.png`
- `manifest.webmanifest`

## Running locally (for developers)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Typical use cases

- Launching a new app and preparing favicon/PWA assets
- Refreshing brand icons without manual resizing/exporting
- Generating social/OG preview assets quickly
